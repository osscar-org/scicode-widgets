scicode-widgets
===============

.. marker-package-description

**scicode-widgets** (pip package name: ``pip install scwidgets``) is a Jupyter widget library.
It is designed to assist in creating "computational experiments" aimed to teach students how to code and interpret computational experiments.
**scicode-widgets** abstracts away technical details and boilerplate code that are not essential for the learning experience. 

Built on top of ipywidgets, the library provides a framework for building interactive educational applications.
The logic is purely written in Python, to simplify the development process for scientific teachers and researchers who are more comfortable with Python than with JavaScript.
