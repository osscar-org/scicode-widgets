scicode-widgets
===============

.. marker-package-description

*scicode-widgets* is a widget library for the purpose of creating computational
experiments for educational content. It is targeted to teach students how to
code and interpret computational experiments while hiding technical details and
boiler plate code that are not essential for the learning experience. The logic
is purely written in Python to simplify the development process for scientific
researchers as they usually are more capable in writing Python code than
JavaScript. It therefore builds on top of widgets provided by ipywidgets to
creating a framework out of it.

Features
